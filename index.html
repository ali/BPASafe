<section id="what">
	<h1>What is BPA?</h1>
	<p>Bisphenol A (BPA) is an organic compound <b>used to make plastics and aluminum cans</b>. It is very dangerous to our health, but still used in the making of ordinary items today. It is an endocrine disruptor, meaning <b>it disturbs the normal activities of natural hormones in the body</b>. This <b>can result in mammary or prostrate cancers, early puberty, reproductive problems, Down Syndrome, ADHD, and/or a decreased sperm count</b>. It is cheap and easy to use in the making of plastics and aluminum cans, which is why <b>it hasn't been banned yet</b>.</p>
